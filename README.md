**This project is the 2nd assignment given in the Object Oriented course, Ariel University.**
**The project revolves around the implmentation of Directed Weighted graphs and contains the following:**

 - Directed Weighted Graph, which represent the graph we'll work on.
 - Directed Weighted Graph algo, which represents the algorithms at work on the given graph.

|getE|Returns a pointer (shallow copy) for the collection representing all the edges|
|removeNode|Deletes the node (with the given ID) from the graph|
|removeEdge|Deletes the edge from the graph|
|nodeSize|Returns the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph|
|edgeSize|Returns the number of edges (assume directional graph)|
|getmaxMin |Restricts the dimension of the graph|

## **DW_GraphAlgo** - implements **DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms**

 
  ***Fields:***
que - Queue 
checkNodes - HashSet  
transposeCheckNodes - HashSet
vis - Map 
prev - Map  
pQue - PriorityQueue

|Method|Description|

|init|Initialize the graph on which this set of algorithms operates on|
|getGraph|Return the underlying graph of which this class works|
|graphTranspose | Transposes the directions of all of the graph's edges |
|copy|Compute a deep copy of this weighted graph|
|isConnected|Returns true if and only if (iff) there is a valid path from each node to each other node in the graph|
|shortestPathDist|returns the length of the shortest path between src to dest|
|shortestPath|returns the the shortest path between src to dest - as an ordered List of nodes|
|center |Attempts to find the center node of the given graph, this function returns the node that is found as center |
|tsp |Implmentation to the "Traveling Salesman Problem", this function goes through a given node list in the most efficient way  |
|save|Saves this weighted (directed) graph to the given file name - in JSON format|

## **How to run :** 
- Download the files.
- Copy the path to the jar file location.
- Pick either one of the exsisting graphs inside the data file (G1, G2, G3).
- Open cmd and type the following :
```console
cd path
```
- Now type in the console :
```console
java -jar Ex2.jar G1.json
```
![bash](https://i.imgur.com/de6d3Ci.png)

***the example given is used upon the G1 graph file, you can pick either one of the existing graphs over the output folder.***

# How to use :
**Pick what action you'd like to use on the graph opened :**
